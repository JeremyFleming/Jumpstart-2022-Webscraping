# Jumpstart-2022-Webscraping
Webscrapes the Jumpstart 2022 pack list from the official Magic: The Gathering website and generates random decklists in a variety of ways.

From the official Magic: The Gathering website: "Jumpstart is a fun, unique way to pick up and play Magic. By combining any two Jumpstart booster packs, you’ll create your own 40-card themed deck—and you’re ready to go." 

This python program simulates this experience digitally by creating decklists of two Jumpstart booster packs. You can create a completely random deck, guarantee two packs with unique colors, or make a deck MTG Arena style by selecting 2 packs from 6 options. If you're looking to play Jumpstart 2022 with a friend on an online client, this program is for you!
